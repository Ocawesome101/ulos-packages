*{NAME}
  wm.item - A library for widget manipulation

*{DESCRIPTION}
  This library provides basic widget support.  For textboxes, see *{wm.textbox}(({3}).

  This library returns one function, which takes a few parameters and returns an object.

    blue{function}(*{window}:green{table}): green{table}
      Creates a new green{items} object over the specified green{window} and returns it.

  Along with all methods provided by an green{app} (excepting blue{:close}()) - the following exclusive method is provided in the returned green{items} object:
    
    blue{:add}(*{item}:green{table})
      Adds another green{item} to the green{items} object.  The provided green{item} must have at least magenta{x}, magenta{y}, magenta{w}, magenta{h}, and *{text} fields.  The *{text} field may be either a red{string} or a green{table} of strings.  Alternatively, if the green{item} has a blue{:refresh}() field, it will be called during the green{items} object's blue{:refresh}() process.
