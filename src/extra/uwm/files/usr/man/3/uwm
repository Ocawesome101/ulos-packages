*{NAME}
  uwm - the ULOS Window Manager API

*{DESCRIPTION}
  This manual page describes the API which *{uwm}(*{1}) presents to all applications running under it.  It also presents the expected structure of an application table.

  Applications are loaded from files in #{/usr/share/apps}.  They are expected to return a table containing the following.  All functions are called with their first argument being the window object, which has a sub-field green{app} that is the actual application.

    magenta{w}
      The width, in characters, of the new window.
    
    magenta{h}
      The height, in characters, of the new window.

    red{name}
      The name of the window.  Defaults to the filename minus the #{.lua} extension (so, the name of the app at #{/usr/share/apps/example.lua} becomes #{example} unless it is set in this field).

    blue{refresh}(*{gpu}: green{table})
      Refreshes the application.  The provided green{gpu} should be used as though only the application is running, and in fullscreen, since each window is its own GPU proxy (see *{gpuproxy}(*{3})).  Whether to actually redraw anything is at the application's discretion - for example, the *{sysmon} app only refreshes most of its content once every few seconds.

    blue{click}(*{x}:magenta{number}, *{y}:magenta{number})
      Called when a window is clicked.  magenta{x} and magenta{y} are relative to the window's position, so the programmer must not compensate for this.

    blue{key}(*{char}:magenta{number}, *{code}:magenta{number})
      Called when a key is pressed while the window is focused.

    blue{focus}()
      Called when the window is focused.  Not called when the window has just been created.

    blue{unfocus}()
      Called when the window is unfocused.

    blue{close}([*{is_shutdown}:red{string}])
      Called when the window is closed.  If red{is_shutdown} is red{"UI_CLOSING"}, this means that *{uwm} is quitting.

  The following fields are provided in the window object passed as *{self} to the above functions:

    *{app}:green{table}
      The application attached to the window.

    *{gpu}:green{table}
      The GPU proxy associated with the window.

    *{buffer}:magenta{number}
      The GPU buffer index associated with the window.

  The window manager adds an additional field to the green{app}:
    
    *{wm}:green{table}:
      *{notify} = blue{function}(*{text}:red{string})
        Prompts the user with the specified red{text} and an *{Ok} button.

      *{menu} = blue{function}(*{x}:magenta{number}, *{y}:magenta{number}, *{title}:red{string}, *{opts}:green{table})
        Presents the user with a menu at the specified coordinates containing the specified items green{opts} and with the specified red{title}.
