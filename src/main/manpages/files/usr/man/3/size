*{NAME}
  size - format sizes

*{DESCRIPTION}
  ${size} is a very simple single-function library.  Provided sizes will be formatted as power-of-2 units (1024-byte KB) by default - however, this may be changed by editing the library and changing the declaration "yellow{local} *{UNIT} = magenta{1024}" on line 14.

*{FUNCTIONS}
  blue{format}(*{n}): red{string}
    Returns the formatted size with a unit specifier (K, M, G, T, P, and E are currently supported) concatenated to it.
