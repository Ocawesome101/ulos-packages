*{NAME}
  readline - readline implementation

*{DESCRIPTION}
  The ${readline} function provides a highly optimized and fairly intuitive form of line editing.  It is similar in style to Bash's line editing (though with a few less features) and very straightforward.

  ${readline} supports text history and may be provided a prompt.

*{USAGE}
  blue{readline}(*{opts}:green{table}): red{string}
    Reads a string from the user, and returns it.

    Available green{opts}:
      *{history}:green{table}
        An array of history entries, with the last entry being the most recent.

      *{prompt}:red{string}
        A prompt to be written before reading input.
