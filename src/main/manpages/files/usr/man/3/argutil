*{NAME}
  argutil - argument parsing utilities

*{DESCRIPTION}
  ${argutil} provies a basic OpenOS-style argument parser to all programs.  It is primarily intended to prevent most programs from requiring their own argument parser.

*{FUNCTIONS}
  blue{parse}(magenta{...}): green{table}, green{table}
    Sort the varargs into green{args} and green{opts}, then return them in that order.  This will work for most things.  When blue{parse} encounters a yellow{--}, it will stop looking for options and dump any remaining varargs into the green{args} table.

    green{args} is simply an array of arguments;  green{opts} is a map, such that green{opts}[*{option}] blue{=} *{value}.
