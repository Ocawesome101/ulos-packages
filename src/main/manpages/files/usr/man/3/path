*{NAME}
  path - file path utilities

*{DESCRIPTION}
  ${path} is a simple library presenting a few functions for file path manipulation.

*{FUNCTIONS}
  blue{split}(*{path}:red{string}): green{table}
    Splits the provided red{path} into segments, compensating for all occurrences of #{..} and #{.} in the path.

  blue{clean}(*{path}:red{string}): red{string}
    Returns a concatenated form of the output of blue{path.split}(red{path}).

  blue{concat}(*{...}:red{string}): red{string}
    Concatenates all the provided paths with #{/}, then returns the cleaned result.

  blue{canonical}(*{path}:red{string}): red{string}
    Returns the absolute, cleaned version of the provided red{path}.  If red{path} does not have a #{/} preceding it, ${path} will concatenate the process working directory ($*{PWD}).
