*{NAME}
  sysfs - a pseudo-filesystem containing certain runtime kernel data

*{DESCRIPTION}
  The ${sysfs} filesystem (mounted at #{/sys}) is a pseudo-filesystem which contains certain volatile kernel data.  It is a combination of Linux's #{/proc}, #{/sys}, and #{/dev} rolled into one (with #{/proc} at #{/sys/proc} and #{/dev} at #{/sys/dev}).  There is also #{/sys/components}, which contains certain component access points.

*{PROCESSES}
  Public process data can be accessed through #{/sys/proc/}magenta{PID} (for example, ${init}'s process data can be accessed under #{/sys/proc/1}).  This process data consists of the following files:

    #{cputime}    CPU time consumed by the process.  Somewhat inaccurate.
    #{deadline}   The process-specific resume deadline.
    #{name}       The process name.
    #{owner}      UID of the process's owner.
    #{status}     Process status (usually red{waiting} when read by another process).
    #{stopped}    Whether the process has been stopped through the *{STOP} signal.
    #{threads}    The number of threads belonging to the process.
    #{waiting}    Whether the process is waiting for something.
    #{handles/}   Directory containing all the process's handles.

*{DEVICES}
  Virtual devices (mostly I/O streams) are accessible in #{/sys/dev}.  It is on the *{ttyN} devices that Refinement spawns each initial ${login} process.

*{COMPONENTS}
  A basic component interface is accessible under #{/sys/components}.  Components are further filtered into #{by-address} and #{by-type} categories.  From #{by-type}, the third GPU detected by the system is accessible under #{/gpu/3}.  If that GPU's address is red{425fae}, then it is also accessible under #{by-address/425fa3}.

  Each component node will contain at least the #{address}, #{slot}, and #{type} fields, corresponding to the relevant *{component} API calls.  If the component is explicitly supported by the kernel driver, there may be additional files corresponding to certain component calls for that component.

*{FILESYSTEMS}
  Filesystem mount information can be obtained through reading #{/sys/mounts}.
