*{NAME}
  tty - user TTY manipulation functions

*{DESCRIPTION}
  The ${tty} API provides three functions useful in conjunction with the *{gpuproxy}(*{3}) API.  These allow the user to get the GPU associated with a TTY, or create or delete a virtual TTY from a provided GPU proxy.

  In the case of both blue{delete} and blue{getgpu}, the magenta{id} argument corresponds to the TTY's yellow{sysfs} ID;  for example, the TTY whose ID is magenta{2} is located at yellow{/sys/dev/tty2}.

*{FUNCTIONS}
  blue{create}(*{gpu}:red{string} or green{table}[, *{screen}: red{string}]): green{table}
    Creates a TTY object over the provided yellow{gpu} and returns a file descriptor from the sysfs.

  blue{delete}(*{id}:magenta{number})
    Delete the TTY with the specified magenta{id}, but only if it is user-created; system-created TTYs may not be removed in this way.

  blue{getgpu}(*{id}:magenta{number}): green{table}
    Returns the GPU object associated with the specified TTY object.
