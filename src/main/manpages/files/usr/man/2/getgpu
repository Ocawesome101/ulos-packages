*{NAME}
  getgpu - Get the GPU associated with a TTY

*{DESCRIPTION}
  ${getgpu} is a function optionally provided by the Cynosure kernel.  It is intended for use in GUI applications such as window managers, where VT100 capability is insufficient;  for most programs, VT100 should be used instead.

*{SIGNATURE}
  blue{getgpu}(*{ttyn}:magenta{number}): green{table}
    Returns the GPU proxy associated with a TTY.  The ID of the current TTY is stored most reliably in green{io.stderr}.magenta{tty}, though unless program output is redirected it can be accessed through the green{stdin} and green{stdout} streams as well.
