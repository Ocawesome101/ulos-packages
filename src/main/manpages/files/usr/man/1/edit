*{NAME}
  edit - simple text editor

*{SYNOPSIS}
  ${edit} *{FILE}

*{DESCRIPTION}
  ${edit} is a basic, highly optimized text editor intended for use where TLE is either not available or too slow.  Its design is intentionally similar to OpenOS's *{edit}, while being only marginally slower (and much faster than Plan9k's *{edit}).

*{BUGS}
  Lines longer than the screen width will break line editing.

  The bottom bar will sometimes scroll up with the text.  This is purely visual.
