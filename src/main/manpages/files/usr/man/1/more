*{NAME}
  more - page text one screenful at a time

*{SYNOPSIS}
  ${more} *{FILE} [*{...}]

*{DESCRIPTION}
  ${more} is a basic text pager program.  *{less}(*{1}) is generally better, and may be somewhat faster;  for lower-memory systems ${more} may be better.

  When ${more} has printed a screenful of text it will prompt the user with *{--MORE--} and wait for a keypress.  If it receives a 'q', ${more} will exit;  otherwise, ${more} will wait for a space (' ').
