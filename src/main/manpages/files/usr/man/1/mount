*{NAME}
  mount - mount and unmount filesystems

*{SYNOPSIS}
  ${mount}
  ${mount} *{NODE LOCATION} [*{FSTYPE}]
  ${mount} -u *{PATH}

*{DESCRIPTION}
  When executed with no arguments, ${mount} will print filesystem mount information equivalent to `*{cat /sys/mounts}'.  When executed with *{NODE} and *{LOCATION}, ${mount} will either use the *{FSTYPE} argument or attempt to automatically determine the filesystem type.  When executed with the *{-u} option, ${mount} will behave like other systems' ${umount}.
