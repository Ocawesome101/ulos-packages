*{NAME}
  ls - list files

*{SYNOPSIS}
  ${ls} [*{options}] *{FILE ...}

*{DESCRIPTION}
  For each *{FILE}, ${ls} lists all files under that *{FILE} if it is a directory, and *{-d} is not specified, or will list information about that file.  Listed files are sorted alphabetically.  If no *{FILE} is specified, ${ls} will list the current directory.

  Supported options are:
    *{-1}
      Print one file per line.

    *{-a}
      Show hidden files (files whose names are preceded with a *{.}).

    *{--color=WHEN}
      If *{WHEN} is "no", ${ls} will not colorize its output;  if *{WHEN} is "always", ${ls} will print colored output even when the output device is not a terminal;  otherwise, ${ls} will print colored output only if the output device is a terminal.

    *{-d}
      List directories in the same way as files, rather than listing their contents.

    *{-h}
      Use human-readable file sizes rather than displaying them as bytes.

    *{-l}
      Display full file information (permissions, owner, size, last modification date) along with the filename, rather than just the filename.
