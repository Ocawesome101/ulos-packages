*{NAME}
  serializer - serialize Lua tables to text

*{DESCRIPTION}
  The ${serializer} function, when given a Lua table as its only argument, will try to serialize that table into a string which can then be written to a file or blue{load}ed again.

  Recursion is handled but cannot be unserialized.  Functions and threads cannot be serialized and so will break unserialization.
