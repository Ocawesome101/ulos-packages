*{NAME}
  upm - the ULOS Package Manager

*{SYNOPSIS}
  ${upm} [*{options}] *{COMMAND} [*{...}]

*{DESCRIPTION}
  ${upm} is the ULOS package manager.  It requires a means of communication with a server from which to download packages, but can download them from anywhere as long as the protocol is supported by the kernel *{network}(*{2}) API.

  Available commands:
    *{install PACKAGE} [*{...}]
      Install the specified *{PACKAGE}(s), if found in the local package lists.

    *{remove PACKAGE} [*{...}]
      Remove the specified *{PACKAGE}(s), if installed.

    *{upgrade}
      Upgrade all local packages whose version is less than that offered by the remote repositories.

    *{update}
      Refresh the local package lists from each repository specified in the configuration file (see *{CONFIGURATION} below).

    *{search PACKAGE} [*{...}]
      For each *{PACKAGE}, search the local package lists and print information about that package.

    *{list} [*{TARGET}]
      List packages.

      If *{TARGET} is specified, it must be one of the following:
        *{installed} (default)
          List all installed packages.

        *{all}
          List all packages in the remote repositories.

        <*{repository}>
          List all packages in the specified repository.

      Other values of *{TARGET} will result in an error.

    *{help}
      See *{--help} below.

  Available options:
    *{-q}
      Suppresses all log output except errors.

    *{-v}
      Be verbose;  overrides *{-q}.

    *{-f}
      Skip checks for package installation status and package version differences.  Useful for reinstalling packages.

    *{-y}
      Assume 'yes' for all prompts;  do not present prompts.

    *{--root}=*{PATH}
      Specify *{PATH} to be treated as the root directory, rather than #{/}.  This is mainly useful for bootstrapping another ULOS system, or for installing packages on another disk.

    *{--help}
      Print the built-in help text.

*{CONFIGURATION}
  ${upm}'s configuration is stored in #{/etc/upm.cfg}.  It should be fairly self-explanatory.
